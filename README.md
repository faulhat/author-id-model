# author-id-model
A handwriting recongition tool for teachers (specifically Mr. Rice)

This project is divided into two parts, a repository for the Tensorflow model to identify handwriting and one for the web app itself. This is the repository for the model. It contains a Flask server meant to be run on localhost so that the other system can query the model.
